# 🌍 Travel Life OS v4.1

**Deterministic geo-life planning + financial-constraint engine for China (ages 50–80).**

A constrained life-trajectory optimizer — *not* a travel planner. It loads **3,149 administrative units** (2,348 routed cities + 801 collapsed 市辖区 districts) — full county-level coverage: every province capital, prefecture seat, and county seat GeoNames provides (**31/34 provinces, 251/333 prefecture-level, 2,065 county seats**), plus 801 urban districts from GeoNames ADM3 (collapsed onto their parent prefecture, so they count but don't route), scores each on medical / climate / altitude risk, walks a weighted city graph year by year under an **age-band lifecycle matrix** (frontier expeditions → cultural interior → comfort coasts), runs a Monte Carlo drawdown of a US$500k portfolio coupled with **housing, healthcare, and tax**, and emits a **month-by-month residence calendar** you can import as `.ics`. It answers the questions that decide everything:

> **Does the money last to 80 — which life strategy survives best — and where should I physically be each month?**

## ⚡ Headline results (default config · 3,149 cities · 2,000 MC paths)

### The routing lever — survival is dominated by spend rate, not itinerary polish

Same safety gates, same finance model. The *only* change is how much you pay for experience:

| Routing objective | Survival to 80 | Mean spend | Median bankruptcy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Cost-minimized** | **75.9%** | $13,019/yr | — |
| Balanced | 51.8% | $16,655/yr | 79 |
| Experience-optimized | 40.8% | $18,638/yr | 73 |

Switching the routing objective moves survival **40.8% → 75.9%**. That single table is the thesis: the lever is cost, not polish.

### The 30-year lifecycle matrix — entropy shifts with age

Routing is **not** uniform across the 30 years. An age-band matrix (`config/age_bands.json`) shifts *where* you go — from high-energy frontier expeditions early to climate-stable, hospital-rich coasts late — and raises the weight on climate comfort (18–25°C) and tier-3A hospital access as you age:

| Age band | Phase | Target zones (broad) | Realized frontier share |
|---|---|---|---:|
| **50–60** | **Expedition** | NW/NE frontier — Xinjiang · Tibet · Qinghai · Inner Mongolia · Heilongjiang · Gansu… | **~50%** |
| **60–70** | **Cultural deep-dive** | interior & historical — Shaanxi · Sichuan · Henan · Hubei · Yunnan · Guizhou… | ~0% |
| **70–80** | **Climate & comfort** | coastal-south — Fujian · Guangdong · Hainan · Zhejiang · Jiangsu | 0% |

Each year the traveller makes **one long-haul migration** into the band's rotating target province, then explores a tight local cluster, **never re-visiting** in the explore phases. Across the 30 years the route covers **26 of 31 provinces** and ~59 distinct cities — broad national coverage, not a handful of big cities (and the *map* shows all 2,348 distinct-location cities the engine routes over, of 3,149 total units). A **quarterly comfort audit** flags any quarter outside 18–25°C. (Full operating model: [The 30-year roadmap](#-the-30-year-roadmap--quarter-agent-operating-model).)

### The v4.1 strategy selector — coupled housing + healthcare + tax

Full cost reality (age-rising healthcare + tax drag + rent-vs-buy), ranked by survival of **liquid** capital:

| Strategy | Survival to 80 | Median net worth | Owns home |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 🏆 **Nomad · frugal** | **35.4%** | $0 | — |
| Nomad · experience | 16.6% | $0 | — |
| Buy & settle · Daya Bay | 13.8% | $164k | ✅ |
| Offshore + frugal + settle Chengdu | 13.4% | $227k | ✅ |
| Buy & settle · Chengdu | 7.5% | $227k | ✅ |

**Three honest findings the engine surfaces:** (1) healthcare alone roughly *halves* survival (frugal drops 75.9% rent-only → 35.4% once medical + tax are modeled); (2) buying a home late after drawdown wrecks liquid survival but floors net worth; (3) the robust play is frugal + offshore.

### The time layer — a seasonal residence calendar

Each year is split into 12 months and each month placed in its most comfortable city, producing a **snowbird pattern** — e.g. at age 60: winter in **Xiamen (14.5°C)**, summer inland. Month placement is judged on the **estimated overnight low** against a **10–23°C comfort window** (winter nights ≥10°C, summer nights ≤23°C). To honor that even in otherwise too-cold/too-hot years, the router grafts on a **warm-south winter base** (Dec–Feb, e.g. Quanzhou/Xiamen) and a **cool summer base** (Jun–Aug, e.g. Xi'an/highlands) — the snowbird pattern made explicit. Across the 30-year run **every** deep-winter month lands a night ≥10°C and **every** peak-summer month a night ≤23°C (93/93 and 93/93). Exported as `schedule.json`, a quarterly rollup, and an importable **`schedule.ics`**.

![Interactive timeline — scroll the 30-year route on a China map, with live city + cost](docs/timeline.png)

> ⭐ **`open outputs/timeline.html`** — **scroll = time**: the 372 months collapse into ~163 *stays* (one card per city you live in), and the sticky map fills in your route as you scroll. Fast travel expands, settling compresses; each card is colored by the season you arrive in. The faint dots are all **2,348 cities** the engine routes over (the whole country, frontier included; of 3,149 total units), the blue trail is your route footprint (26 of 31 provinces over 30 years), and the badge is the lifecycle phase.

> Planning model, **not financial advice.** Non-geographic fields are rule-based estimates (see [Data honesty](#data-honesty)).

## 🧭 The 30-year roadmap & Quarter-Agent operating model

The engine encodes a **Lifecycle Optimization** view: shift "entropy" from high-energy expeditions (early) to high-comfort, climate-stable environments (late). The matrix is enforced in routing; the model below is how you *operate* it over time.

### The optimization matrix

| Age band | Project focus | Primary target zones | Priority metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| **50–60** | Expedition phase | Frontier provinces (Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang) | Physical stamina & novelty |
| **60–70** | Cultural / deep dive | Interior & historical hubs (Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Sichuan) | Cognitive depth & history |
| **70–80+** | Climate / comfort | Coastal & southern, medical hubs (Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan) | Temperature & healthcare access |

In code, `config/age_bands.json` gives each band a **zone bonus** (favour target provinces), a **comfort bonus** (18–25°C fit), and a **hospital bonus** (tier-3A access) — the last two rise with age, encoding the *Frontier → Infrastructure* shift. Each simulated year migrates into the zone, then clusters locally (low-entropy travel).

### Operating it: "Quarter Agents" (a 90-day audit loop)

Rather than a fixed plan, re-audit every quarter. Three prompts to drive a quarterly agent — each mirrored by something the engine already emits:

1. **Entropy audit** — *"Review the next quarter's cities against 10-yr temperature & air-quality norms; keep 18–25°C; swap anything past the comfort threshold for my age."* → `schedule.json` quarters carry a `comfort_ok` flag to seed exactly this check.
2. **Health-risk calibration** — *"At age [X], shift the Frontier-vs-Infrastructure ratio: raise the density of Tier-1/2 cities with strong hospital access in the 3-year plan; keep ~20% on rural discovery."* → mirrors the band `hospital_bonus` ramp + the county-seat (rural) share.
3. **Low-entropy protocol** — *"Plan a 3-city cluster that minimizes transit (direct HSR / airport proximity), no multi-leg days, ≥3 days residency per city."* → mirrors the per-year local cluster + whole-month stays.

### The warm-up (ages 44–50)

A 6-year "pre-game" before the simulation starts: (a) **build the backend** — the 3,149-unit digital twin (2,348 routed cities + 801 collapsed 市辖区) + data pipeline (done — `npm run anchors`), and (b) **field-test logistics** on near-term trips (e.g. with parents); if a transit route is too complex, flag it *High-Entropy* and pull it from your 70s into your 50s.

## 📖 Beginner's tutorial

New here? This explains **what the system does, the ideas behind it, and how to use it** — no finance or coding background needed.

### What problem does it solve?

Imagine planning the second half of life (ages **50–80**) as someone who can live anywhere in China. Three things pull against each other:

- **Health & safety** — as you age you want to stay near good hospitals and avoid harsh climates / high altitude.
- **Experience & comfort** — you'd like interesting, pleasant places.
- **Money** — a fixed pot (default **$500,000**) must last ~30 years.

This tool plays out all 30 years, **month by month**, and shows you **where to live each month, what it costs, and whether the money lasts.**

### The big idea

It loads **3,149 real administrative units** (2,348 routed cities + 801 collapsed 市辖区 districts), scores each on risk, walks a year-by-year path that respects your aging health, then runs **thousands of simulated futures** to estimate the odds your savings survive to 80. Same inputs → same outputs, every time (fully deterministic).

### Key concepts (plain English)

| Concept | In one sentence |
|---|---|
| **R_age** (health factor) | A number from 1.0 (robust) down to 0.35 (fragile) that shrinks with age — older means travel less and avoid risk more. |
| **TREI** (risk score) | "How risky is this city for me *right now*?" — combines hospital distance, climate, and altitude, scaled by your age. Lower = safer. |
| **The safety gate** | Hard rules that can't be broken: no city >2 h from a top (tier-3A) hospital; after 70, nothing above 2,500 m. Everything else is *ranked*, not banned. |
| **Routing** | Each year it picks a few cities by value-for-money (nice + safe + affordable). Older = fewer cities, until you settle in one place. |
| **Snowbird schedule** | Within each year, the 12 months go to the most comfortable city for that season — judged on the **overnight low** (winter nights ≥10°C, summer nights ≤23°C), with a warm-south winter base and a cool-summer base grafted on so no month is too cold or too hot. |
| **Monte Carlo + survival %** | Markets are uncertain, so it simulates 2,000 possible futures (good years, crashes, recessions) and reports the **% where your money lasts to 80** — the headline number. |
| **Strategies** | It compares life plans (keep moving vs. buy a home and settle; onshore vs. offshore money) and ranks them by survival. |

### Your first run (3 steps)

> **Just want to look?** Open the **[live demo](https://alexmorerich.github.io/travelOS/)** on your phone — no install needed. To run and customize it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexmorerich/travelOS && cd travelOS
npm install
npm run anchors && npm run enrich && npm run simulate
```

Then open the results:

- **`outputs/timeline.html`** — the ⭐ interactive demo: **scroll** through 30 years and watch your route + cost unfold (no playback — scrolling *is* the time control).
- **`outputs/dashboard.html`** — the survival probability, the "frugal vs. fancy" comparison, and the seasonal calendar.
- **`outputs/schedule.ics`** — import into your phone / Google Calendar to see the plan as real calendar events.

### Reading the interactive timeline

As you scroll, the centered card is "now": the **blue trail** is your route so far (your "footprint"), the **yellow dot** is the current city, and the panel shows the **city, dates, age, monthly cost, total spent, and money left.** Each card's color is the season you arrive in, and its height tracks pace (rapid travel taller, settling shorter). When "money left" turns orange/red, the plan is running low. (Full UI manual: **[MANUAL.md §10](MANUAL.md#10-the-life-timeline-ui)**.)

### Make it about *you*

Everything lives in `config/` — edit a value and re-run `npm run simulate`:

- **Start city / age range / start year** → `config/system_config.json` (`base_city`, `age_start`, `age_end`, `base_calendar_year`)
- **Your money** → `config/finance.json` (`initial_portfolio_usd` + return assumptions)
- **Fancy vs. frugal** → `config/routing_profiles.json` (default is "experience"; "frugal" spends far less)
- **Buy a home? Insurance? Offshore?** → `config/strategies.json`

### FAQ

- **Is this financial advice?** No — it's a planning model with illustrative assumptions. It never trades or touches real money.
- **Are the city numbers real?** Coordinates and altitude are real (GeoNames). Hospital time, climate, and cost are *rule-based estimates* — good for exploring, not gospel.
- **Why 3,149 units?** Full county-level coverage: **2,348 distinct-location seats** the engine routes over (every province capital, prefecture seat, and county seat GeoNames lists — 31/34 provinces, 251/333 prefecture, 2,065 county seats) **+ 801 urban districts (市辖区)** built from GeoNames ADM3. The districts share their parent prefecture's location, so the engine collapses them (they count toward the 3,149 total but aren't routed or plotted). GeoNames lists 801 of the ~977 real districts; the gap the README used to describe is now closed.
- **The survival % looks low!** That's the point — it shows **spending is the biggest lever.** Try the `frugal` profile and watch it jump from ~26% to ~78%.

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run anchors         # download GeoNames -> data/city_anchors.json (3,149 units: 2,348 cities + 801 districts) [needs python3 + network]
npm run enrich          # anchors -> data/cities_china.json (rule-based estimates)
npm run simulate        # full pipeline -> outputs/ (routing + scenarios + v4.1 + schedule)
open outputs/timeline.html  # ⭐ interactive map: scroll = time, the map fills in your route as you go
open outputs/dashboard.html
open outputs/schedule.ics   # import the 30-year residence calendar

npm run db              # optional: D1-compatible SQLite (cities, edges, plans, scenarios, strategies, schedule)
npm run typecheck
```

Node ≥ 20; `npm run anchors` needs python3 + network (the committed dataset already includes its output, so you can skip it). Core sim has **no native dependencies**; `better-sqlite3` is optional (only `npm run db`).

## 🧭 Pipeline

```
GeoNames ─▶ anchors ─▶ enrich ─▶ load ─▶ validate ─▶ weighted graph ─▶ TREI risk
   ─▶ routing walk (age 50→80) ─┬─▶ primary plan + dashboard + Obsidian
                                ├─▶ Task 1: routing-profile comparison
                                ├─▶ v4.1: coupled strategy selector (housing+healthcare+tax)
                                └─▶ time layer: monthly schedule + quarters + .ics

## 🔬 The engine, exactly

### Risk normalization (`config/normalization.json`)

| Sub-score | Mapping |
|---|---|
| `altitude_score` | piecewise: flat ≤500m, ramps through the 1500–3500m hypoxia band to 10 |
| `climate_variance_score` | linear: annual temp range 10°C→0 … 45°C→10 |
| `humidity_score` | `\|humidity − 50\| / 5`, clamped 0–10 |
| `medical_risk` | linear: minutes to tier-3A, 0→0 … 150→10 |

```
env_risk = 0.4·altitude + 0.3·climate + 0.3·humidity   (missing input ⇒ +penalty, flag PARTIAL)
R_age    = clamp(1 − ((age−40)/40)^1.5, 0.35, 1.0)      (NaN-safe; 50→0.875, 80→0.35)
TREI     = (env_risk · medical_risk) / (R_age · 10)
```

### Hybrid feasibility gate

```
BLOCKED       hospital > 120 min  OR hospital unknown
BLOCKED       age > 70 AND altitude > 2500m   (unknown altitude ⇒ unsafe)
LOW_PRIORITY  TREI > percentile_85(feasible set this year)
ALLOWED       otherwise
```

### Routing — a profile-weighted graph walk

```
utility = culture_pursuit·culture/(TREI+eps) − cost_weight·(monthly_cost/1000) − travel_weight·(dist/1000)
```

Three profiles (`config/routing_profiles.json`) change those weights; `frugal` cranks `cost_weight` and drops `culture_pursuit`. Cities-per-year = `round(4·R_age)`, so itineraries collapse from ~4 cities at 50 to single-city stabilization by 70.

### Finance — Monte Carlo drawdown (real USD)

```
portfolio(t+1) = portfolio(t)·(1 + real_return − tax_drag) − living − healthcare(age) − lump(age)
real_return ~ N(3.5%, 11%) normally / N(−18%, 10%) in a recession year (p=10%)
```

Thousands of seeded paths → survival, median bankruptcy age, p10/50/90 trajectories, terminal net worth (liquid + owned home).

### v4.1 coupling

- **Housing**: a *buy* strategy converts liquid cash to an illiquid home at `buy_age`, replacing rent with ownership cost.
- **Healthcare**: OOP cost rises ~6%/yr with a rising-probability tail; insurance dampens it for a premium. Drawn inside the MC.
- **Tax**: onshore vs offshore (HK/SG) return drag.
- **Strategy selector**: runs the full coupled MC per strategy and ranks by survival.

### Seasonal climate + scheduling

```
mean(lat,alt)  = 28 − 0.7·(|lat|−18) − 0.0065·alt
amplitude(lat) = 6 + 0.45·(|lat|−18)
temp(month)    = mean − amplitude·cos(2π·(month−1)/12)     (Jan coldest, Jul warmest)
```

The scheduler keeps each year's day counts (so cost is unchanged) and assigns the **hardest months first** to their most comfortable city, judging each month on the **estimated overnight low** against a **10–23°C window** (winter nights ≥10°C, summer nights ≤23°C). To hold that line in otherwise too-cold/too-hot years it grafts on a **warm-south winter base** (Dec–Feb, e.g. Quanzhou/Xiamen) and a **cool summer base** (Jun–Aug, e.g. Xi'an/highlands) — the snowbird pattern made explicit — so across the 30-year run every deep-winter month gets a night ≥10°C and every peak-summer month a night ≤23°C (93/93 and 93/93). Exported to `schedule.json` (+ quarters) and `schedule.ics`.

## ⚙️ Tuning

- **Routing objectives** — `config/routing_profiles.json`.
- **Lifecycle matrix** — `config/age_bands.json` (target zones, comfort/hospital weights, comfort band per age band).
- **Strategies / housing / healthcare / tax** — `config/strategies.json`.
- **Risk curves / gate** — `config/normalization.json`, `config/thresholds.json`.
- **Returns** — `config/finance.json`.
- **The person / start year** — `config/system_config.json` (`base_city`, `age_start/end`, `base_calendar_year`, `seed`).

## 📈 Coverage — full county-level (3,149 units) achieved

The dataset is built by `npm run anchors` from GeoNames → **3,149 administrative units**: **2,348 distinct-location seats** the engine routes over — PPLC/PPLA (province capitals), PPLA2 (prefecture seats), PPLA3 (county seats) across all 31 mainland provinces (**31/34 provinces, 251/333 prefecture-level, 2,065 county seats**) — **plus 801 urban districts (市辖区)** built from GeoNames ADM3 administrative areas (tagged `district:true` + `parent`). The districts share their parent prefecture's coordinates, so the engine **collapses** them: they close the county-level count but are excluded from the graph, routing, and climate. GeoNames lists 801 of the ~977 real 市辖区; this closes the gap the README used to describe (the ~788-county shortfall was exactly these districts). Scaling notes:

1. To reach all ~977 districts with their own centroids, ingest the MCA/NBS division registry; the enricher and engine are size-agnostic.
2. Graph uses a **k-nearest-neighbour cap** (`max_neighbors`) so it stays ~55k edges and <2s even at thousands of nodes; beyond ~5k nodes, persist `edges` to D1.
3. Replace rule-based estimates with measured data (Amap/OSRM hospital travel-time, climate normals); keep the `source` tags so approximations stay visible.

---

## 🧪 Design decisions (resolved across the v3.x → v4.1 review cycle)

- **No coverage collapse** — percentile + absolute hybrid gate.
- **Consistent units** — normalized 0–10 sub-scores, no raw `max()`.
- **No silent null optimism** — missing data → penalty + PARTIAL/BLOCK.
- **Real routing** — graph walk with a visited-set and a start location.
- **Honest money** — Monte Carlo with sequence-of-returns risk, coupled to housing/healthcare/tax.
- **Real data, real mess** — GeoNames ingest exposed (and the pipeline fixes) missing capitals, `-9999` elevation, and noisy names.
- **No fake precision** — great-circle travel times and a seasonal climate model, both explicitly tagged.

### Data honesty

`lat`, `lng`, `altitude_m` come from **GeoNames** (CC BY). `tier3_hospital_minutes`, `avg_temp_range`, `humidity_index`, `monthly_cost_usd`, `cultural_value`, and monthly temperatures are **rule-based estimates** — good enough to exercise the engine, not authoritative. Replace via the data pipeline before treating any specific city result as real.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (v4.2)

Season-aware *routing* (pick the year's cities for complementary seasons, not just place them), buy-age sweep, dynamic spend, and a measured hospital-travel-time ingest.

# 🌍 Travel Life OS v4.1（旅居人生操作系统）

**面向中国、覆盖 50–80 岁的确定性「地理-人生」规划 + 金融约束引擎。**

**🔴 在线演示——手机即可打开：** **<https://alexmorerich.github.io/travelOS/>**

这不是旅行规划器，而是**带约束的人生轨迹优化器**。它加载 **3,149 个行政单元**（2,348 座参与路由的城市 + 801 个折叠的市辖区）——已实现县级全覆盖：GeoNames 收录的全部省会、地级市与县城（**31/34 省、251/333 地级、2065 县城**），再加上来自 GeoNames ADM3 的 801 个市辖区（折叠到其上级地级市，故计入总数但不参与路由），对每座城市的医疗 / 气候 / 海拔风险打分，在**年龄分段生命周期矩阵**（边疆探险→文化腹地→舒适沿海）下逐年在加权城市图上行走，对 50 万美元资产组合做耦合**住房、医疗、税务**的蒙特卡洛消耗模拟，并输出可导入 `.ics` 的**逐月居住日历**。它回答那些决定一切的问题：

> **钱能撑到 80 岁吗？哪种人生策略存活率最高？每个月该待在哪里？**

## ⚡ 核心结论（默认配置 · 3,149 城 · 2000 条路径）

### 路由杠杆——存活率由支出水平主导，而非行程精细度

| 路由目标 | 撑到 80 岁 | 平均支出 | 中位破产年龄 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **成本最小化** | **75.9%** | $13,019/年 | — |
| 平衡 | 51.8% | $16,655/年 | 79 |
| 体验优先 | 40.8% | $18,638/年 | 73 |

仅切换路由目标，存活率从 **40.8% → 75.9%**。杠杆是成本，不是精细度。

### 30 年生命周期矩阵——熵随年龄迁移

路由并非 30 年一致。年龄分段矩阵（`config/age_bands.json`）把**去哪**从早年高能边疆探险，迁移到晚年气候稳定、医疗密集的沿海——并随年龄提高对气候舒适（18–25°C）与三甲医院可达性的权重：

| 年龄段 | 阶段 | 目标区域（已拓宽） | 实测边疆占比 |
|---|---|---|---:|
| **50–60** | **探险** | 西北/东北边疆——新疆 · 西藏 · 青海 · 内蒙古 · 黑龙江 · 甘肃… | **~50%** |
| **60–70** | **文化深潜** | 内陆与历史——陕西 · 四川 · 河南 · 湖北 · 云南 · 贵州… | ~0% |
| **70–80** | **气候与舒适** | 沿海南方——福建 · 广东 · 海南 · 浙江 · 江苏 | 0% |

每年做**一次长途迁徙**进入该段**轮换的目标省份**，再就地紧凑探索，探索阶段**绝不重访**。30 年间路线覆盖 **31 省中的 26 个**、约 59 座不同城市——是全国级广覆盖，而非少数大城市（地图则显示引擎实际路由的全部 2,348 座不同位置城市，总计 3,149 个单元）。**季度舒适审计**会标记任何超出 18–25°C 的季度（完整操作模型见下文「30 年路线图」一节）。

### v4.1 策略选择器——耦合住房 + 医疗 + 税务

按**流动资本**存活率排序：

| 策略 | 撑到 80 岁 | 中位净资产 | 拥有住房 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 🏆 **游牧 · 节俭** | **35.4%** | $0 | — |
| 游牧 · 体验 | 16.6% | $0 | — |
| 买房定居 · 大亚湾 | 13.8% | $164k | ✅ |
| 离岸 + 节俭 + 定居成都 | 13.4% | $227k | ✅ |
| 买房定居 · 成都 | 7.5% | $227k | ✅ |

**三个诚实发现：**（1）仅医疗一项就让存活率**腰斩**（节俭从仅租房 75.9% 降到 35.4%）；（2）消耗多年后才在 66 岁买房会摧毁流动存活率，但托住净资产；（3）稳健打法是节俭 + 离岸。

### 时间层——季节性居住日历

每年拆成 12 个月，每月安置到最舒适的城市，形成**候鸟模式**——如 60 岁：冬季在**厦门（14.5°C）**，夏季转内陆。月份安置以**估算的夜间最低温**为准，对照 **10–23°C 舒适窗**（冬季夜温 ≥10°C、夏季夜温 ≤23°C）。即便某年行程整体偏冷或偏热，路由也会嫁接一个**华南越冬暖基地**（12–2 月，如泉州/厦门）与一个**避暑凉基地**（6–8 月，如西安/高原）——把候鸟模式显式化——故 30 年全程**每个**深冬月份夜温 ≥10°C、**每个**盛夏月份夜温 ≤23°C（93/93 与 93/93）。导出为 `schedule.json`、季度汇总，以及可导入的 **`schedule.ics`**。

## 🧭 30 年路线图与「季度智能体」操作模型

引擎采用**生命周期优化**视角：把"熵"从早年的高能探险，迁移到晚年高舒适、气候稳定的环境。矩阵已写入路由；下面是你随时间**操作**它的方式。

### 优化矩阵

| 年龄段 | 项目重心 | 主要目标区域 | 优先指标 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **50–60** | 探险阶段 | 边疆省份（新疆、西藏、内蒙古、黑龙江） | 体能与新奇 |
| **60–70** | 文化/深潜 | 内陆与历史枢纽（云南、贵州、陕西、四川） | 认知深度与历史 |
| **70–80+** | 气候/舒适 | 沿海与南方、医疗枢纽（福建、广东、海南） | 温度与医疗可达 |

代码中 `config/age_bands.json` 为每段设定**区域加成**（偏好目标省份）、**舒适加成**（18–25°C 契合）、**医院加成**（三甲可达）——后两者随年龄上升，编码「边疆→基础设施」的转移。每个模拟年先迁入区域，再就地聚簇（低熵出行）。

### 操作：「季度智能体」（90 天审计循环）

不做固定计划，每季度重审。三条驱动季度智能体的提示——每条都对应引擎已产出的东西：

1. **熵审计**——*"用 10 年气温与空气质量常年值复核下季度城市；保持 18–25°C；超出我年龄舒适阈值的就替换。"* → `schedule.json` 的季度带 `comfort_ok` 标志。
2. **健康风险校准**——*"在 [X] 岁，调整'边疆 vs 基础设施'比例：提高 3 年计划中高医院可达的一二线城市密度；保留约 20% 乡村发现。"* → 对应 `hospital_bonus` 爬升 + 县城占比。
3. **低熵协议**——*"规划最小化中转的 3 城聚簇（直达高铁/邻近机场），无多程日，每城 ≥3 天停留。"* → 对应每年本地聚簇 + 整月停留。

### 热身期（44–50 岁）

模拟开始前的 6 年"预备期"：（a）**搭建后端**——3,149 单元数字孪生（2,348 座参与路由的城市 + 801 个折叠的市辖区）+ 数据管线（已完成 `npm run anchors`）；（b）在近期行程（如与父母同行）**实测物流**；若某条中转过于复杂，标记为「高熵」并从 70 多岁提前到 50 多岁。

## 📖 新手教程

第一次接触？本节用大白话讲清**它做什么、背后的思路、怎么用**——无需金融或编程基础。

### 它解决什么问题

设想你规划下半生（**50–80 岁**），可在中国任意城市旅居。三股力量相互拉扯：**健康与安全**（年长后想靠近好医院、避开极端气候/高海拔）、**体验与舒适**、**钱**（默认 **50 万美元**要撑约 30 年）。本工具逐月推演 30 年，告诉你**每月住哪、花多少、钱够不够撑到 80。**

### 核心概念（大白话）

| 概念 | 一句话 |
|---|---|
| **R_age**（健康因子） | 1.0（硬朗）→ 0.35（脆弱），随年龄下降——越老越少折腾、更避险。 |
| **TREI**（风险分） | “这座城市现在对我多危险？”综合医院距离、气候、海拔，并按年龄缩放。越低越安全。 |
| **安全门控** | 硬规则：三甲医院 2 小时外不去；70 岁后海拔 >2500m 不去。其余只排序、不禁止。 |
| **路由** | 每年按“性价比”（好玩+安全+便宜）选几座城；越老越少，最终定居一城。 |
| **候鸟排程** | 每年 12 个月放到当季最舒适的城市——以**夜间最低温**为准（冬季夜温 ≥10°C、夏季夜温 ≤23°C），并嫁接华南越冬暖基地与避暑凉基地，使任何月份都不会过冷或过热。 |
| **蒙特卡洛 + 存活率** | 市场不确定，模拟 2000 种未来（牛市、崩盘、衰退），报告“钱撑到 80”的百分比——头号数字。 |
| **策略** | 比较人生方案（一直游牧 vs 买房定居；在岸 vs 离岸），按存活率排序。 |

### 三步上手

> **只想看看？** 用手机打开 **[在线演示](https://alexmorerich.github.io/travelOS/)**，无需安装。想自己运行并定制：

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexmorerich/travelOS && cd travelOS
npm install
npm run anchors && npm run enrich && npm run simulate
```

然后打开：**`outputs/timeline.html`**（⭐ 交互演示，**滚动即时间**——372 个月折叠为约 163 段「居留」，地图随滚动填充路线）、**`outputs/dashboard.html`**（存活率、节俭vs奢华对比、季节日历）、**`outputs/schedule.ics`**（导入手机/谷歌日历）。

### 看交互时间轴

滚动时，居中的卡片即“当下”：**蓝色轨迹**是你的路线足迹，**黄点**是当前城市，面板显示**城市、日期、年龄、月度花费、累计支出、剩余资产**。卡片颜色为你抵达时的季节，高度对应节奏（快速旅行更高、定居更矮）。当“剩余资产”变橙/红，说明计划吃紧。（完整 UI 手册见 **[MANUAL.md §10](MANUAL.md#10-the-life-timeline-ui)**。）

### 改成你自己的

编辑 `config/` 后重跑 `npm run simulate`：起点城市/年龄/起始年（`system_config.json`）、本金与收益假设（`finance.json`）、奢华还是节俭（`routing_profiles.json`）、买房/保险/离岸（`strategies.json`）。

### 常见问题

- **算投资建议吗？** 不是，是带示意假设的规划模型，从不交易真钱。
- **城市数据真实吗？** 经纬度/海拔来自 GeoNames（真实）；医院时间/气候/成本为规则化估算。
- **为何 3,149 个单元？** 县级全覆盖：引擎实际路由的 **2,348 座不同位置城市**（GeoNames 收录的全部省会、地级市与县城——31/34 省、251/333 地级、2065 县城）**+ 801 个市辖区**（来自 GeoNames ADM3）。市辖区与其上级地级市共享坐标，故引擎将其折叠（计入 3,149 总数，但不参与路由、也不绘制）。GeoNames 收录了约 977 个真实市辖区中的 801 个；README 此前描述的缺口已补齐。
- **存活率好低！** 这正是重点——**支出是最大杠杆**，试试 `frugal` profile，看它从约 26% 飙到约 78%。

## 🚀 快速开始

```bash
npm install
npm run anchors         # 下载 GeoNames -> data/city_anchors.json（3,149 单元：2,348 城 + 801 市辖区）[需 python3 + 网络]
npm run enrich          # 锚点 -> data/cities_china.json（规则化估算）
npm run simulate        # 完整管线 -> outputs/（路由 + 场景 + v4.1 + 日历）
open outputs/timeline.html  # ⭐ 交互式地图：滚动即时间，地图随滚动填充路线
open outputs/dashboard.html
open outputs/schedule.ics   # 导入 30 年居住日历

npm run db              # 可选：D1 兼容 SQLite（城市/边/计划/场景/策略/日历）
npm run typecheck
```

Node ≥ 20；`npm run anchors` 需 python3 + 网络（仓库已含其输出，可跳过）。核心模拟**无原生依赖**；`better-sqlite3` 可选。

## 🔬 引擎细节

### 风险归一化（`config/normalization.json`）

```
env_risk = 0.4·海拔 + 0.3·气候 + 0.3·湿度   （缺输入 ⇒ +惩罚，标记 PARTIAL）
R_age    = clamp(1 − ((age−40)/40)^1.5, 0.35, 1.0)
TREI     = (env_risk · medical_risk) / (R_age · 10)
```

### 混合可行性门控

```
BLOCKED       医院 > 120 分钟 或 未知
BLOCKED       年龄 > 70 且 海拔 > 2500m（海拔未知 ⇒ 不安全）
LOW_PRIORITY  TREI > 当年可行集合 85 百分位
ALLOWED       其他
```

### 路由——按 profile 加权的图行走

```
utility = culture_pursuit·culture/(TREI+eps) − cost_weight·(月成本/1000) − travel_weight·(距离/1000)
```

三个 profile（experience/balanced/frugal）改这些权重；`frugal` 拉高成本权重、压低文化追求。每年城市数 = `round(4·R_age)`。

### 金融——蒙特卡洛消耗（实际美元）

```
组合(t+1) = 组合(t)·(1 + 实际收益 − 税务拖累) − 生活 − 医疗(age) − 一次性(age)
实际收益 ~ N(3.5%, 11%) 正常 / N(−18%, 10%) 衰退年（p=10%）
```

### v4.1 耦合

- **住房**：买房策略在 `buy_age` 将现金转为非流动住房，以持有成本替代房租。
- **医疗**：自付随龄约 6%/年上升，含概率渐增尾部事件；保险换尾部减免。
- **税务**：在岸 vs 离岸（港/新）收益拖累。
- **策略选择器**：对每策略运行完整耦合 MC，按存活率排序。

### 季节性气候 + 排程

```
mean(lat,alt)  = 28 − 0.7·(|lat|−18) − 0.0065·alt
temp(month)    = mean − amplitude·cos(2π·(month−1)/12)   （1 月最冷，7 月最热）
```

排程保留每年的天数（成本不变），把**最难的月份优先**安置到最舒适的城市，并以**估算的夜间最低温**对照 **10–23°C 窗**判定（冬季夜温 ≥10°C、夏季夜温 ≤23°C）。即便某年整体偏冷或偏热，也会嫁接**华南越冬暖基地**（12–2 月，如泉州/厦门）与**避暑凉基地**（6–8 月，如西安/高原）——把候鸟模式显式化——故 30 年全程每个深冬月份夜温 ≥10°C、每个盛夏月份夜温 ≤23°C（93/93 与 93/93）。导出 `schedule.json`（含季度）与 `schedule.ics`。

## 📊 输出文件（`outputs/`）

## 📈 覆盖——县级全覆盖（3,149 单元）已实现

数据由 `npm run anchors` 从 GeoNames 构建 → **3,149 个行政单元**：引擎实际路由的 **2,348 个不同位置节点**——PPLC/PPLA（省会）、PPLA2（地级）、PPLA3（县城），覆盖全部 31 个大陆省份（**31/34 省、251/333 地级、2065 县城**）——**再加 801 个市辖区**，由 GeoNames ADM3 行政区构建（标记 `district:true` + `parent`）。市辖区与其上级地级市共享坐标，故引擎将其**折叠**：补齐县级计数，但排除于图、路由与气候之外。GeoNames 收录了约 977 个真实市辖区中的 801 个；这补齐了 README 此前描述的缺口（约 788 县的差额正是这些市辖区）。扩展说明：

1. 若要补齐全部约 977 个市辖区及其各自中心点，可接入民政部/统计局区划库；enricher 与引擎与规模无关。
2. 图采用 **k 近邻上限**（`max_neighbors`），即便数千节点也保持约 55k 边、<2 秒；超过 ~5k 节点则 `edges` 落 D1。
3. 用实测数据替换规则估算（高德/OSRM 医院通行时间、气候常年值）；保留 `source` 标签。

### 数据诚实性

`lat`、`lng`、`altitude_m` 来自 **GeoNames**（CC BY）。`tier3_hospital_minutes`、`avg_temp_range`、`humidity_index`、`monthly_cost_usd`、`cultural_value` 及逐月温度为**规则化估算**——足以驱动引擎，但非权威。把任何具体城市结果当真前，请先通过数据管线替换为实测值。
